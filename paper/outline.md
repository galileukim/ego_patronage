* are partisan affiliations durable? when did we see an increase in the degree of partisan affiliation
* are there regions where we observe greater prevalence of partisan affiliation?
* what are the benefits of being a party member?
    * do we observe systematic differences in terms of compensation for party members? think about compensation, tenure, type of contract offered.
    * where are party members predominantly located?
* thinking about the population as a whole, where are party members more likely to be concentrated?
    * are there party members concentrated in the upper strata? lower strata?
    * are party members local elites that are hogging resources for themselves?
    * or is it more likely that we observe party members in the lower strata of society.
    * there are a lot of questions that can be explored in this way, perhaps look at the likelihood of individuals becoming party members.
    * similar in vein to the work by olke "who becomes a politician?"
* it is also possible to look at which occupations individuals come from.
    * similar to what I had done with SINE, look for every year what kind of work trajectory each worker has.
    * assess the extent to which these people are coming from wealthy or poor backgrounds.
