* are partisan affiliations durable? when did we see an increase in the degree of partisan affiliation
* are there regions where we observe greater prevalence of partisan affiliation?
* what are the benefits of being a party member?
    * do we observe systematic differences in terms of compensation for party members? think about compensation, tenure, type of contract offered.
    * where are party members predominantly located?
* thinking about the population as a whole, where are party members more likely to be concentrated?
    * are there party members concentrated in the upper strata? lower strata?
    * are party members local elites that are hogging resources for themselves?
    * or is it more likely that we observe party members in the lower strata of society.
    * there are a lot of questions that can be explored in this way, perhaps look at the likelihood of individuals becoming party members.
    * similar in vein to the work by olke "who becomes a politician?"
* it is also possible to look at which occupations individuals come from.
    * similar to what I had done with SINE, look for every year what kind of work trajectory each worker has.
    * assess the extent to which these people are coming from wealthy or poor backgrounds.

* who becomes a bureaucrat? partisan selection and patronage in municipalities in Brazil.
    * partisanship is an elite game.
    * what does elite mean here?
        * instead of concentrating in the bottom strata of the population, it mostly locates itself in the upper strata of the formal employees.
        * partisanship is concentrated in the upper strata of the bureaucracy, in particular at the executive positions, rather than the service positions.
        * party members receive a higher compensation than their non-partisan counterparts, while remaining less educated and insulated. this evokes the image of a club good, where public sector employment literally becomes a turf in which each party seeks to establish their own turf.
        * this matches with the empirical findings of brollo and colonnelli, who find that campaign contributors and party members aligned with the mayor are the ones most likely to receive job offers into the public sector.
        * this suggests that instead of serving as an instrument to receive votes, party machines operate with a different strategy, securing support from local elites rather than seeking to buy votes (Lizzeri and Persico).

* it would be interesting to further understand what are the strategic considerations that take place in the allocation of these executive positions.
    * in the education patronage, I find that it is coalition dynamics that take place.
    * but clearly, some positions are more valueable than others, and when vereadores are deciding whom to appoint to these positions, there must be some form of consideration regarding the potential returns of these allocations.
    * education is not necessarily a criterion, as I find that these party members tend to be older and less educated than their non-partisan counterparts.
    * but there is also the possibility that 

* so what?
    * partisanship is not necessarily linked to better outcomes for social welfare.
    * in particular, it can be an exclusionary way of allocating public sector employment to the wealthy strata of the local economy.
    * rewarding loyalists and economic elites at the local level facilitate pervasive growth in the distribution of resources in the local economy.
