# plan:

## research questions: 
* who benefits from patronage and what is the nature of the transaction?
  * can we identify which sectors individuals are coming from?
  * what are the areas of the bureaucracy most exposed to patronage?
* private gains from employment vs. public gains from better services.
  * frame it in terms of the immediate gains from employment vs. an uncertain .
  * do voters care more about what is privately best for them or do they consider social welfare more broadly?
* what is a visible good?
  * here it is not about a visible public good: think roads, bridges, light.
  * it’s about what’s concealed: I will take away this public sector employment for myself - a    gato, so to speak - and people won’t necessarily know.
  * but once enough of us are doing it, the whole electric grid collapses.
