## intro

this document outlines the vision for the third paper in my dissertation.

## research questions 
* who benefits from patronage and what is the difference in compensation?
  * what are the areas of the bureaucracy most exposed to patronage?
  * can we identify which sectors individuals are coming from?
* private gains from employment vs. public gains from better services.
  * frame it in terms of the immediate gains from employment vs. an uncertain benefit from services.
  * what is the magnitude of the gains: compare to earnings from informal sector (pnad?)
  * compare the lowest rung, always with respect to the private sector.
  * do voters care more about what is privately best for them or do they consider social welfare more broadly?
  * once enough of us are doing it, the whole electric grid collapses.

## requirements
* identified rais panel data:
  - complete
* partisanship data:
  - currently working
* city councilors - and their own earnings
* qualitative evidence
* create sql database using SQLite
  - in progress

## timeline
* for next week:
  - finish cleaning the filiados data.
  - merge filiado data with rais.
  - estimate the probability of getting employed.
* give a sense of the magnitude of the gains from employment.
* compare private gains vs. public gains from better services.
