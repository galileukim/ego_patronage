## intro

this document outlines the vision for the third paper in my dissertation.

## research questions 
* who benefits from patronage and what is the difference in compensation?
  - what are the areas of the bureaucracy most exposed to partisanship?
  - can we identify which sectors individuals are coming from?
* understand the flows of party members into the bureaucracy.
  - which areas are these individuals coming into?
  - are they treated differentially?
* private gains from employment vs. public gains from better services.
  - frame it in terms of the immediate gains from employment vs. an uncertain benefit from services.
  - similar to the tragedy of the commons: once enough of us are doing it, the electric grid collapses (gato).

## requirements
* identified rais panel data:
  - complete
* partisanship data:
  - complete
* city councilors - and their own earnings
  - complete
* qualitative evidence
* create sql database using SQLite
  - in progress

## timeline
* give a sense of the magnitude of the gains from employment.
* compare private gains vs. public gains from better services.
